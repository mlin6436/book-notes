### Part II - The Method

> Principled negotiation, or negotiation on the merits - Harvard Negotiation Project

#### Chapter 2 - Separate the PEOPLE from the Problem

- Why it is wise to separate people from the problem
  - Negotiators are people first
  - Every negotiator has two kinds of interests: in the substance and in the relationship
  - The relationship tends to become entangled with the problem.
  - Positional bargaining puts relationship and substance in conflict
- How to deal with the people problem, directly
  - Accurate perception
    - Put yourself in their shoes
      - People tend to see what they want to see
      - Understanding other's point of view is not the same as agreeing with it, even though a better understanding may lead you to revise your own
      - Don't deduce their intentions from your fears
      - Don't blame them for your problem
      - Even if blaming is justified, it is just counterproductive
    - Discuss each other's perceptions
    - Look for opportunities to act inconsistently with their perceptions
    - Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process
    - Face-saving: Make your proposals consistent with their values
  - Appropriate emotion
    - First recognize and understand emotions, theirs and yours
    - Make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate
    - Allow the other side to let off steam
    - Don't react to emotional outbursts
    - Use symbolic gestures
  - Clear communication
    - Communication problems 
      - Negotiators may not be talking to each other, or at least not in such a way as to be understood
      - Even if you are talking directly and clearly to them, they may not be hearing you
      - Misunderstanding and misinterpretation
    - Listen actively and acknowledge what is being said, including their perceptions, needs and constraints
    - Speak to be understood
    - Speak about yourself, not about them
    - Speak for a purpose
  - Prevention works best
    - Build a working relationship
    - Face the problem, not the people

#### Chapter 3 - Focus on INTERESTS, Not Positions

### Chapter 4 - Invent OPTIONS for Mutual Gain

- Develop multiple options to choose from; decide later

### Chapter 5 - Insist on Using Objective CRITERIA

- Try to reach a result based on standards independent of will
- Reason and be open to reasons; yield to principle, not pressure

## üìù Notes

### Chapter 1

[Your notes for Chapter 1]

### Chapter 2

> A basic fact about negotiation, easy to forget in corporate and international transactions, is that you are dealing not with abstract representatives of the "other side," but with human beings. They have emotions, deeply held values, and different backgrounds and viewpoints; and they are unpredictable. So are you.

> Whatever else you are doing at any point during a negotiation, from preparation to follow-up, it is worth asking yourself, "Am I paying enough attention to the people problem?"

> In fact, with many long-term clients, business partners, family members, fellow professionals, government officials, or foreign nations, the ongoing relationship is far more important than the outcome of any particular negotiation.

> Deal with people problems directly; don't try to solve them with substantive concessions.

> In negotiating it is easy to forget that you must deal not only with their people problems, but also with your own. Your anger and frustration may obstruct an agreement beneficial to you. Your perceptions are likely to be one-sided, and you may not be listening or communicating adequately.

> Understanding the other side's thinking is not simply a useful activity that will help you solve your problem. Their thinking is the problem. Whether you are making a deal or settling a dispute, differences are defined by the difference between your thinking and theirs.

> The more quickly you can turn a stranger into someone you know, the easier a negotiation is likely to become. You have less difficulty understanding where they are coming from. You have a foundation of trust to build upon in a difficult negotiation. You have smooth, familiar communication routines. It is easier to defuse tension with a joke or an informal aside.
