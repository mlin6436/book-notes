> Principled negotiation, or negotiation on the merits - Harvard Negotiation Project

#### Chapter 2 - Separate the PEOPLE from the Problem

- Why it is wise to separate people from the problem
  - Negotiators are people first
  - Every negotiator has two kinds of interests: in the substance and in the relationship
  - The relationship tends to become entangled with the problem.
  - Positional bargaining puts relationship and substance in conflict
- How to deal with the people problem, directly
  - Accurate perception
    - Put yourself in their shoes
      - People tend to see what they want to see
      - Understanding other's point of view is not the same as agreeing with it, even though a better understanding may lead you to revise your own
      - Don't deduce their intentions from your fears
      - Don't blame them for your problem
      - Even if blaming is justified, it is just counterproductive
    - Discuss each other's perceptions
    - Look for opportunities to act inconsistently with their perceptions
    - Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process
    - Face-saving: Make your proposals consistent with their values

      - Misunderstanding and misinterpretation
    - Listen actively and acknowledge what is being said, including their perceptions, needs and constraints
    - Speak to be understood
    - Speak about yourself, not about them
    - Speak for a purpose
  - Prevention works best
    - Build a working relationship
    - Face the problem, not the people

#### Chapter 3 - Focus on INTERESTS, Not Positions

- For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions
  - Interests define the problem
  - Behind opposed positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones
- How do you identify interests?
  - Ask "Why?" 
  - Ask "Why not?" Think about their choice
    - "Whose decision do I want to affect?"
    - "What decision people on the other side now see me asking them to make"
    - "What are the consequences, as the other side would probably see them, of agreeing or refusing to make the decision I am asking for"
  - Realize that each side has multiple interests
    - Pursue my independent and our shared interests
    - Don't assume the interests from both sides are aligned from the start
  - The most powerful interests are basic human needs
    - Security
    - Economic well-being
    - A sense of belonging
    - Recognition
    - Control over one's life
  - Make a list

  - Put the problem before your answer
  - Look forward, not back
  - Be concrete but flexible
  - Be hard on the problem, soft on the people

### Chapter 4 - Invent OPTIONS for Mutual Gain

- Diagnosis
  - Premature criticism - premature judgment
  - Premature closure - searching for the single answer
  - The assumption of a fixed pie
  - Thinking that "solving their problem is their problem"
- Prescription
  - Separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them - invent first, decide later: `Brain storming`
  - Broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer
    - Multiply options by shuttling between the specific and the general: `The Circle Chart`
    - Look through the eyes of different experts
    - Invent agreements of different strengths
    - Change the scope of a proposed agreement
  - Look for mutual gain
    - Identify shared interests
      - Shared interests lie latent in every negotiation
      - Shared interests are opportunities, not godsends
      - Stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable
    - Dovetail differing interests: different beliefs, values placed on time, forecast, risk
      - Ask for their preferences
  - Make their decision easy
    - 

### Chapter 5 - Insist on Using Objective CRITERIA

## 📝 Notes

### Chapter 1

[Your notes for Chapter 1]

### Chapter 2

> A basic fact about negotiation, easy to forget in corporate and international transactions, is that you are dealing not with abstract representatives of the "other side," but with human beings. They have emotions, deeply held values, and different backgrounds and viewpoints; and they are unpredictable. So are you.

> Whatever else you are doing at any point during a negotiation, from preparation to follow-up, it is worth asking yourself, "Am I paying enough attention to the people problem?"

> In fact, with many long-term clients, business partners, family members, fellow professionals, government officials, or foreign nations, the ongoing relationship is far more important than the outcome of any particular negotiation.

> Deal with people problems directly; don't try to solve them with substantive concessions.

> In negotiating it is easy to forget that you must deal not only with their people problems, but also with your own. Your anger and frustration may obstruct an agreement beneficial to you. Your perceptions are likely to be one-sided, and you may not be listening or communicating adequately.

> Understanding the other side's thinking is not simply a useful activity that will help you solve your problem. Their thinking is the problem. Whether you are making a deal or settling a dispute, differences are defined by the difference between your thinking and theirs.

> The more quickly you can turn a stranger into someone you know, the easier a negotiation is likely to become. You have less difficulty understanding where they are coming from. You have a foundation of trust to build upon in a difficult negotiation. You have smooth, familiar communication routines. It is easier to defuse tension with a joke or an informal aside.

### Chapter 3

> To understand that negotiator's interests means to understand the variety of somewhat differing interests that he needs to take into account.

> In searching for the basic interests behind a declared position, look particularly for those bedrock concerns which motivate all people. If you can take care of such basic needs, you increase the chance both of reaching agreement and, if an agreement is reached, of the other side's keeping to it.

> One guideline is be specific. Concrete details not only make your description credible, they add impact

> People listen better if they feel that you have understood them. They tend to think that those who understand them are intelligent and sympathetic people whose own opinions may be worth listening to. So if you want the other side to appreciate your interests, begin by demonstrating that you appreciate theirs.

> If you want someone to listen and understand your reasoning, give your interests and reasoning first and your conclusions or proposals later.

> The question "Why?" has two quite different meanings. One looks backward for a cause and treats our behavior as determined by prior events. The other looks forward for a purpose and treats our behavior as subject to our free will. We need not enter into a philosophical debate between free will and determinism in order to decide how to act. Either we have free will or it is determined that we behave as if we do. In either case, we make choices. We can choose to look back or to look forward.

> In a negotiation you want to know where you are going and yet be open to fresh ideas. To avoid having to make a difficult decision on what to settle for, people will often go into a negotiation with no other plan than to sit down with the other side and see what they offer or demand.

> Having thought about your interests, you should go into a meeting not only with one or more specific options that would meet your legitimate interests but also with an open mind. An open mind is not an empty one.

> You can be just as hard in talking about your interests as any negotiator can be in talking about his position. In fact, it is usually advisable to be hard. It may not be wise to commit yourself to your position, but it is wise to commit yourself to your interests. This is the place in a negotiation to spend your aggressive energies. The other side, being concerned with their own interests, will tend to have overly optimistic expectations of the range of possible agreements. Often the wisest solutions, those that produce the maximum gain for you at the minimum cost to the other side, are produced only by strongly advocating your interests. Two negotiators, each pushing hard for their interests, will often stimulate each other's creativity in thinking up mutually advantageous solutions.

> Negotiating hard for your interests does not mean being closed to the other side's point of view. Quite the contrary. You can hardly expect the other side to listen to your interests and discuss the options you suggest if you don't take their interests into account and show yourself to be open to their suggestions. Successful negotiation requires being both firm and open.

### Chapter 4

> Even apart from a shared interest in averting joint loss, there almost always exists the possibility of joint gain. This may take the form of developing a mutually advantageous re- lationship, or of satisfying the interests of each side with a creative solution.

> If dovetailing had to be summed up in one sentence, it would be: Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa. Differences in interests, priorities, beliefs, forecasts, and attitudes toward risk all make dovetailing possible. A negotiator's motto could be "Vive la difference!"
